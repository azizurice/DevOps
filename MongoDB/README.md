# MongoDB
MongoDB is a document database built on a scale-out(horizontal) architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications using agile methodologies. It stores data as BSON documents which is a binary representation of JSON.  The BSON encoding extends JSON with additional types such as int, long, date, floating point, and decimal128. This makes it much easier for applications using MongoDB to reliably process, sort, and compare data.

Hereâ€™s a JSON document describing contact information with location:

```json
{
  "_id":ObjectId("5ad88534e3632e1a35a58d00"),
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe" },
    "address": [
              { "location": "work",
                "address": {
                    "street": "16 Hatfields",
                    "city": "London",
                    "postal_code": "SE1 8DJ"
                  },
                "geo": { "type": "Point",
                          "coord": [
                              51.5065752,
                              -0.109081
                            ]
                      }
              },
            ],
    "phone": [
              { "location": "work",
                "number": "+44-1234567890"},
            ],
    "dob": ISODate("1977-04-01T05:00:00Z"),
    "retirement_fund":NumberDecimal("1292815.75")
}

[MongoDB Architecture](https://info-mongodb-com.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MongoDB_Architecture_Guide.pdf)

### Document Databases

  Document : A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects like the above one.

  Collections/Views/On-Demand Materialized Views : MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases. In addition to collections, MongoDB supports: Read-only Views and On-Demand Materialized Views.

###  Key Features

    High Performance

    Rich Query Language

    High Availability

    Horizontal Scalability

    Support for Multiple Storage Engines
